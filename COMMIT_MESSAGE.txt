refactor: modularize aspect and replace system prints with logging

This commit refactors the KafkaListenerAspect to improve maintainability
and code quality by:

- Breaking down the monolithic 425-line aspect into focused components:
  * EventUnwrapper: handles event unwrapping from various formats
  * RetryOrchestrator: manages retry logic and attempt tracking
  * DLQRouter: handles dead letter queue routing
  * MetricsRecorder: records metrics using Micrometer
  * CircuitBreakerWrapper: wraps circuit breaker functionality

- Replacing all System.out.println and System.err.println calls with
  proper SLF4J logging throughout the codebase

- Updating logging messages to start with lowercase letters for
  consistency

- Fixing exception message casing to match test expectations

- Maintaining full backward compatibility with existing functionality

- All tests pass successfully after refactoring

This refactoring improves code organization, maintainability, and makes
the library more suitable for collaboration while preserving all existing
functionality.
