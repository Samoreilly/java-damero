================================================================================
                    KAFKA DAMERO - PROJECT IDEAS & FEATURE SUGGESTIONS
================================================================================

This document contains niche, big-picture ideas that would add significant value
to the Kafka Damero library. These are features library users would want in
production-grade Kafka retry/DLQ management systems.

================================================================================
                        1. CIRCUIT BREAKER INTEGRATION
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Integrate circuit breaker patterns (Resilience4j/Hystrix) to prevent
cascading failures when a downstream service is consistently failing.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Currently, your library retries indefinitely (up to maxAttempts) even if the
  target service is completely down
- Users waste retry attempts on services that won't recover soon
- A circuit breaker can short-circuit retries when failure rate exceeds threshold

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Add @CircuitBreaker annotation or configuration on @CustomKafkaListener
- Track failure rates per topic/service
- Open circuit after X failures in Y time window
- Half-open state to test recovery
- When circuit is open, immediately send to DLQ without retries
- Optional: send circuit breaker state events to monitoring topic

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    dlqTopic = "orders-dlq",
    circuitBreaker = true,
    circuitBreakerFailureThreshold = 50,  // failures
    circuitBreakerWindowDuration = 60000  // 1 minute window
  )


================================================================================
                        2. RATE LIMITING & THROTTLING
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Built-in rate limiting per listener to prevent overwhelming downstream
services or violating API rate limits.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users often process Kafka messages faster than downstream services can handle
- Without rate limiting, retries can compound the problem
- Critical for avoiding API throttling (429 errors)
- Enables graceful degradation under load

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Token bucket or sliding window rate limiter per @CustomKafkaListener
- Configurable messages per second/minute/hour
- Pause consumer threads when rate limit reached
- Optional: exponential backoff on rate limit errors (429)
- Metrics: track rate limit hits

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    rateLimit = "100/m",  // 100 messages per minute
    rateLimitBurst = 20    // allow burst of 20
  )


================================================================================
                   3. MESSAGE DEDUPLICATION & IDEMPOTENCY
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Prevent duplicate message processing using message IDs and in-memory
or distributed cache (Redis) for deduplication.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Kafka can redeliver messages (rebalances, manual seeks, consumer lag)
- Retries can cause duplicate processing if not handled
- Critical for financial transactions, order processing
- Users currently must implement this themselves

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Extract message ID from event (via extractEventId) or Kafka message key
- Store processed message IDs with TTL (in-memory or Redis)
- Skip processing if ID already seen
- Optional: configurable deduplication window
- Support both per-instance (in-memory) and distributed (Redis) modes

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    enableDeduplication = true,
    deduplicationStore = "redis",  // or "memory"
    deduplicationWindow = "24h"
  )


================================================================================
                   4. SCHEDULED/CRON-BASED RETRY STRATEGY
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Retry messages only during specific time windows (e.g., business hours,
avoiding maintenance windows, rate limit reset times).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Some services are only available during business hours
- External APIs have rate limit reset windows
- Users want to retry during off-peak hours to reduce load
- Avoid retrying during scheduled maintenance

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Cron expression support in retry scheduling
- Schedule retry for next available window
- Skip retries outside allowed windows (send to DLQ after window expires)
- Support timezone-aware scheduling

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    retrySchedule = "0 9-17 * * MON-FRI",  // 9 AM to 5 PM weekdays
    timezone = "America/New_York"
  )


================================================================================
             5. DLQ REPLAY & FORENSICS TOOLING
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Built-in API and tooling to replay messages from DLQ, either to
original topic or a different topic, with metadata reset or preserved.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Operations teams need to investigate and replay failed messages
- Current DLQ is read-only; users need programmatic replay capability
- Critical for fixing data issues and reprocessing corrected events
- Reduces manual intervention and operational overhead

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- REST API: POST /api/dlq/{topic}/replay
- Support replay to original topic or custom topic
- Options: reset metadata (fresh retry) or preserve history
- Bulk replay with filters (date range, exception type, attempts)
- Audit log of replay operations

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  POST /api/dlq/orders-dlq/replay
  {
    "targetTopic": "orders",
    "resetMetadata": true,
    "filter": {
      "fromDate": "2024-01-01",
      "exceptionType": "TimeoutException"
    }
  }


================================================================================
                   6. HEALTH CHECKS & READINESS PROBES
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Spring Boot Actuator health indicators for Kafka connectivity,
consumer lag, DLQ depth, and circuit breaker states.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Kubernetes deployments need health/readiness probes
- Operations teams need visibility into library health
- Critical for automated deployments and scaling decisions
- Enables proactive alerting on degraded states

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Implement HealthIndicator for:
  * Kafka broker connectivity
  * Consumer lag per topic
  * DLQ depth (if too many messages, service is degraded)
  * Circuit breaker states (how many are open)
  * Retry scheduler health (thread pool saturation)
- Expose via /actuator/health
- Configurable health thresholds

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  GET /actuator/health
  {
    "status": "UP",
    "kafka": {
      "status": "UP",
      "consumerLag": { "orders": 0, "payments": 5 },
      "dlqDepth": { "orders-dlq": 10, "payments-dlq": 0 },
      "openCircuits": 0
    }
  }


================================================================================
             7. DISTRIBUTED TRACING & CORRELATION IDS
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Automatic correlation ID propagation through Kafka headers and
integration with OpenTelemetry/Zipkin for end-to-end tracing.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users need to trace messages across multiple services and retries
- Current retries create new traces; hard to track retry history
- Critical for debugging complex event flows
- Enables performance analysis across retry attempts

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Auto-generate or extract correlation ID from Kafka headers
- Propagate correlation ID in EventWrapper metadata
- Integration with OpenTelemetry for automatic span creation
- Create child spans for each retry attempt
- Add correlation ID to all logs and DLQ messages

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    enableTracing = true,
    correlationIdHeader = "X-Correlation-ID"
  )


================================================================================
                  8. METRICS EXPORT (MICROMETER/PROMETHEUS)
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Comprehensive metrics export for retry counts, DLQ depths, processing
times, exception rates, and circuit breaker states.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users need metrics for monitoring and alerting
- Currently no visibility into retry patterns or failure rates
- Critical for production observability
- Enables SLO/SLA tracking

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Micrometer integration for Spring Boot Actuator
- Metrics:
  * kafka.damero.retry.count{topic,attempt}
  * kafka.damero.dlq.depth{topic}
  * kafka.damero.processing.time{topic,success/failure}
  * kafka.damero.exception.count{topic,exception_type}
  * kafka.damero.circuit.state{topic,open/closed/half-open}
  * kafka.damero.rate.limit.hits{topic}

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  # Prometheus metrics automatically exported
  kafka_damero_retry_count_total{topic="orders",attempt="1"} 150.0
  kafka_damero_dlq_depth{topic="orders-dlq"} 5.0


================================================================================
             9. EXCEPTION-TYPE CONDITIONAL RETRY LOGIC
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Configure retry behavior based on exception types. Some exceptions
should retry (TimeoutException), others should go straight to DLQ (IllegalArgumentException).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Not all exceptions warrant retries (e.g., validation errors won't succeed on retry)
- Users waste retry attempts on non-retriable failures
- Improves DLQ quality (only true failures, not validation errors)
- Reduces latency for non-retriable errors

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Configure retriable exception types per listener
- Whitelist or blacklist approach
- Custom exception classifier strategy interface
- Default: retry on all exceptions (current behavior)

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    retriableExceptions = {TimeoutException.class, IOException.class},
    nonRetriableExceptions = {IllegalArgumentException.class, ValidationException.class}
  )


================================================================================
                 10. EVENT SOURCING INTEGRATION
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Native support for event sourcing patterns with version handling,
event replay, and snapshot support.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Many Kafka users implement event sourcing
- Retries can create duplicate events if not handled
- Need to handle event versioning and idempotency
- Critical for CQRS architectures

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Support event version in EventWrapper
- Automatic event replay from event store
- Snapshot integration for fast recovery
- Idempotency handling for event sourcing
- Optional: separate DLQ for version conflicts

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    eventSourcing = true,
    eventStore = "event-store"
  )


================================================================================
                 11. SCHEMA REGISTRY INTEGRATION
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Support for Confluent Schema Registry with Avro/Protobuf serialization
and schema evolution handling in retries.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Many production Kafka deployments use Schema Registry
- Current implementation only supports JSON
- Schema evolution can break retries if schemas change
- Critical for large-scale, polyglot Kafka deployments

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Integrate Confluent Schema Registry client
- Support Avro and Protobuf serializers/deserializers
- Schema version tracking in EventWrapper
- Handle schema evolution in retries (read with old schema, write with new)
- Auto-configured schema registry beans

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    schemaRegistry = true,
    schemaFormat = "avro"  // or "protobuf"
  )


================================================================================
                   12. MULTI-BROKER SUPPORT
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Support different Kafka brokers for different topics (e.g., primary
broker for processing, secondary broker for DLQ, separate brokers per environment).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Enterprise deployments often have separate Kafka clusters
- Users may want DLQ in a different cluster for isolation
- Disaster recovery scenarios
- Multi-region deployments

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Per-topic broker configuration
- Separate KafkaTemplate per broker
- Auto-discovery of broker for topic
- Configuration via properties or annotations

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    broker = "primary-kafka:9092",
    dlqTopic = "orders-dlq",
    dlqBroker = "secondary-kafka:9092"
  )


================================================================================
              13. EXACTLY-ONCE SEMANTICS & TRANSACTIONS
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Support Kafka transactions for exactly-once processing semantics
across retries and DLQ writes.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Critical for financial and transactional use cases
- Current implementation uses at-least-once (messages can be processed multiple times)
- Ensures DLQ writes are atomic with processing
- Prevents duplicate processing across retries

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Transactional KafkaTemplate support
- Wrap retry/DLQ operations in transactions
- Idempotent producer configuration
- Transactional consumer configuration
- Handle transaction rollback on failures

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    transactional = true,
    transactionTimeout = 60000
  )


================================================================================
                 14. MESSAGE ENRICHMENT PIPELINE
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Interceptor-style pipeline to enrich messages before processing
(e.g., fetch user data, validate, add context).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users often need to enrich messages before processing
- Retries should use cached enrichment data
- Avoids repeated enrichment calls on retries
- Common pattern in event-driven architectures

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Interceptor interface for message enrichment
- Enrichment data cached in EventWrapper
- Skip enrichment on retries (use cached data)
- Chain multiple interceptors

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    enrichments = {UserEnrichment.class, ValidationEnrichment.class}
  )


================================================================================
                   15. PARALLEL & CONCURRENT PROCESSING
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Built-in support for parallel message processing with thread pools,
worker queues, and backpressure handling.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Some messages are CPU-intensive or I/O-bound
- Current implementation processes sequentially
- Users need parallel processing with controlled concurrency
- Critical for high-throughput scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Configurable thread pool per listener
- Async processing mode with CompletableFuture
- Backpressure when thread pool is saturated
- Order preservation option (per partition key)
- Metrics for queue depth and processing times

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    parallelProcessing = true,
    threadPoolSize = 10,
    preserveOrder = true
  )


================================================================================
                      16. MESSAGE PRIORITY QUEUES
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Support message priority handling within Kafka topics using
custom partitioners and priority-aware consumers.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Some messages are more urgent than others
- Users need to process high-priority messages first
- Current FIFO processing doesn't support priorities
- Critical for SLA-sensitive applications

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Priority field in EventWrapper or Kafka headers
- Custom partitioner that routes by priority
- Priority-aware consumer that processes high-priority partitions first
- Retry with priority preserved

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    priorityEnabled = true,
    priorityHeader = "X-Priority"  // HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
  )


================================================================================
                   17. TIME-BASED RETRY WINDOWS
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Retry messages only within specific time windows from initial failure
(e.g., retry within 24 hours, then send to DLQ).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Some failures are time-sensitive (e.g., expired tokens)
- Users want to stop retrying after a certain time period
- Reduces unnecessary retries on stale failures
- Works with scheduled retry windows

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Max retry window duration configuration
- Calculate time since first failure
- Stop retries after window expires
- Send to DLQ with "RETRY_WINDOW_EXPIRED" reason

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    maxRetryWindow = "24h",
    retrySchedule = "0 9-17 * * MON-FRI"
  )


================================================================================
                   18. WEBHOOK & ALERT INTEGRATIONS
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Send webhook notifications or alerts when messages go to DLQ,
circuit breakers open, or retry limits are reached.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Operations teams need immediate alerts on failures
- Integration with PagerDuty, Slack, email, etc.
- Proactive monitoring and incident response
- Critical for production operations

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Configurable webhook URLs per listener or globally
- Event hooks: onDlq, onCircuitOpen, onMaxRetries
- Retry webhook delivery with exponential backoff
- Template-based message formatting
- Integration with popular alerting services

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    webhooks = {
      "https://hooks.slack.com/...",
      "https://api.pagerduty.com/..."
    },
    alertOnDlq = true,
    alertOnCircuitOpen = true
  )


================================================================================
                 19. DLQ ANALYTICS & DASHBOARD
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Built-in dashboard or API to analyze DLQ patterns: failure trends,
top exceptions, failure rates by time, topic health scores.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users need insights into failure patterns
- Identify problematic services or time periods
- Prioritize DLQ remediation efforts
- Track improvement over time

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Aggregate DLQ metadata into analytics store (in-memory or DB)
- REST API for analytics queries
- Optional: simple dashboard UI
- Metrics: failure rate trends, exception distribution, top failing messages
- Export analytics data

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  GET /api/dlq/analytics/orders-dlq?window=7d
  {
    "failureRate": 0.05,
    "topExceptions": [
      {"type": "TimeoutException", "count": 45},
      {"type": "SQLException", "count": 12}
    ],
    "trend": "decreasing",
    "healthScore": 0.95
  }


================================================================================
                 20. MESSAGE TRANSFORMATION PIPELINE
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Declarative message transformation before processing (validation,
format conversion, field mapping, enrichment).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Messages often need transformation before processing
- Users duplicate transformation logic across listeners
- Retries should use transformed version, not re-transform
- Common pattern in event-driven systems

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Transformation interface/SPI
- Chain multiple transformations
- Cache transformed message in EventWrapper
- Built-in transformations: JSON path extraction, field mapping, validation
- Custom transformation plugins

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    transformations = {
      @Transform(type = "validate", schema = "order-schema.json"),
      @Transform(type = "enrich", source = "user-service"),
      @Transform(type = "map", mapping = "order-mapping.yaml")
    }
  )


================================================================================
                   21. DEAD LETTER QUEUE EXPIRATION
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Automatic cleanup of old DLQ messages based on retention policies
with optional archival to cold storage.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- DLQ can grow indefinitely without cleanup
- Storage costs increase over time
- Some messages are no longer relevant after time period
- Compliance requirements for data retention

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Configurable DLQ retention policy (time-based or size-based)
- Automatic archival to S3/GCS before deletion
- Expiration metadata in EventWrapper
- Optional: notification before expiration
- Audit log of expired messages

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    dlqTopic = "orders-dlq",
    dlqRetention = "90d",
    dlqArchiveTo = "s3://dlq-archive/orders-dlq"
  )


================================================================================
                   22. BATCH PROCESSING SUPPORT
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Process Kafka messages in batches for improved throughput and
atomic batch operations.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Batch processing is more efficient than single messages
- Users need atomic batch operations (all succeed or all fail)
- Reduces overhead in high-throughput scenarios
- Common pattern in data processing pipelines

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Batch mode annotation
- Collect messages up to batch size or timeout
- Process batch atomically
- Retry entire batch if any message fails
- DLQ entire batch or individual messages

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    batchMode = true,
    batchSize = 100,
    batchTimeout = 5000
  )
  public void processBatch(List<OrderEvent> events) {
    // Process entire batch
  }


================================================================================
                  23. CUSTOM RETRY STRATEGY SPI
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Strategy pattern interface for custom retry logic implementations
beyond the built-in delay methods.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Built-in delay methods don't cover all use cases
- Users need custom retry logic (e.g., adaptive delays based on response times)
- Enables plugin ecosystem for custom strategies
- Future-proofs the library

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- RetryStrategy interface with calculateDelay method
- Register custom strategies as beans
- Reference strategy by name in annotation
- Built-in strategies: LINEAR, EXPO, etc.
- Strategy receives context: attempts, exceptions, metadata

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @Component
  public class AdaptiveRetryStrategy implements RetryStrategy {
    public long calculateDelay(RetryContext context) {
      // Custom logic based on context
    }
  }

  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    retryStrategy = "adaptiveRetryStrategy"
  )


================================================================================
                   24. MESSAGE ROUTING & SPLITTER
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Route messages to different topics or listeners based on content,
with support for message splitting and aggregation.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users need conditional routing based on message content
- Split large messages into smaller ones
- Route to different processors based on message type
- Common pattern in event-driven architectures

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Router interface for message routing decisions
- Support routing to multiple topics (splitter pattern)
- Route based on message content, headers, or metadata
- Preserve retry/DLQ behavior per route

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    router = OrderRouter.class
  )
  public class OrderRouter implements MessageRouter {
    public List<String> route(OrderEvent event) {
      if (event.isHighValue()) return List.of("high-value-orders");
      return List.of("standard-orders");
    }
  }


================================================================================
                   25. SECURITY & ENCRYPTION SUPPORT
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Built-in support for message encryption at rest and in transit,
with key management integration.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Production Kafka deployments require encryption
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Users need field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Critical for enterprise deployments

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Encryption/decryption interceptors
- Support for multiple encryption algorithms
- Integration with key management services (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
- Field-level encryption support
- Encrypted EventWrapper serialization

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    encryption = true,
    encryptionAlgorithm = "AES-256-GCM",
    keyManager = "aws-kms",
    encryptedFields = {"creditCard", "ssn"}
  )


================================================================================
                        26. MULTI-TENANT SUPPORT
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Isolated retry/DLQ handling per tenant in multi-tenant applications,
with tenant-specific configurations.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- SaaS applications need per-tenant isolation
- Different retry policies per tenant
- Tenant-specific DLQ topics
- Critical for enterprise SaaS

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Extract tenant ID from message (header or content)
- Tenant-specific retry configuration lookup
- Isolated DLQ per tenant or tenant-prefixed topics
- Tenant-aware metrics and monitoring

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    multiTenant = true,
    tenantExtractor = TenantIdExtractor.class,
    tenantDlqPattern = "{tenant}-orders-dlq"
  )


================================================================================
                   27. EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Built-in support for Saga pattern, Event Sourcing, CQRS, and other
event-driven architecture patterns with retry/DLQ integration.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users implement these patterns frequently

  )


================================================================================
                   28. PERFORMANCE PROFILING & BOTTLENECK DETECTION
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Automatic performance profiling of message processing to identify
bottlenecks, slow operations, and optimization opportunities.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Users need visibility into processing performance
- Identify slow listeners or operations
- Optimize retry timing based on actual processing times
- Critical for high-performance systems

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Automatic method-level timing
- Slow operation detection and alerting
- Performance metrics per listener
- Bottleneck analysis reports
- Integration with APM tools

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    enableProfiling = true,
    slowOperationThreshold = 1000  // ms
  )


================================================================================
                     29. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION MODES
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Configurable degradation modes when systems are under stress:
throttle, skip non-critical messages, or use cached responses.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Systems under load need graceful degradation
- Prevent cascading failures
- Maintain critical operations while skipping non-critical
- Critical for resilience patterns

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Degradation strategy interface
- Automatic degradation triggers (circuit open, high load, rate limits)
- Message priority for degradation decisions
- Configurable degradation modes per listener

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",
    degradationMode = DegradationMode.THROTTLE,

  )


================================================================================
                    30. MESSAGE VERSIONING & MIGRATION
================================================================================

NICHE IDEA: Handle message schema versioning and automatic migration between
versions during processing and retries.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Event schemas evolve over time
- Retries may encounter old schema versions
- Need automatic migration to current schema
- Critical for long-running event processing

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Schema version tracking in EventWrapper
- Version migration strategies
- Backward/forward compatibility handling
- Automatic schema migration on retry
- Version-aware serialization

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  @CustomKafkaListener(
    topic = "orders",

                              CONCLUSION
================================================================================

These features would transform Kafka Damero from a retry/DLQ library into a
comprehensive Kafka resilience and observability platform. Focus on the highest
impact features first (metrics, health checks, conditional retries) while
keeping the library's simplicity and ease of use.

The key is to balance feature richness with maintainability and user experience.
Each feature should be opt-in and well-documented.
