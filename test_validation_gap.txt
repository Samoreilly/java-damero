WHAT THE TESTS CURRENTLY VALIDATE

1. Aspect Interception - YES
   - testAspectIsActive() verifies the aspect intercepts the method
   - If aspect wasn't working, the event wouldn't be processed

2. Retry Logic Works - YES
   - testFailedEventWithRetries() verifies 3 attempts are made
   - Tracks attempt counts using AtomicInteger in TestKafkaListener
   - We can see attempt counts increment from logs

3. Multiple Events Process Correctly - YES
   - testMultipleEvents() verifies mixed success/failure scenarios
   - Validates successful events get processed once
   - Validates failed events are attempted 3 times

WHAT THE TESTS DON'T VALIDATE

1. DLQ Topic Name - NO
   - Tests specify dlqTopic="test-dlq" but never verify messages go there
   - No consumer reads from the DLQ topic to confirm
   - The DLQ topic is created but no one checks if it received messages

2. DLQ Message Content - NO
   - We don't verify what data is sent to DLQ
   - We don't check EventWrapper is used correctly
   - We don't verify exception information is stored

3. DLQ Actually Sent - NO
   - KafkaDLQ.sendToDLQ() is called but we don't verify it succeeded
   - No Kafka consumer reads from "test-dlq" topic to confirm messages arrived
   - We only verify the retry loop worked, not the DLQ delivery

HOW TO PROPERLY VALIDATE DLQ

To fix this, you should add:

1. A DLQ Consumer in the Test
   Add a consumer that listens to "test-dlq" topic:

   @KafkaListener(topics = "test-dlq", groupId = "dlq-test-consumer")
   public void consumeDLQMessage(EventWrapper wrapper) {
       dlqMessages.add(wrapper);
   }

2. Verify DLQ Messages Received
   In the test assertions, verify the DLQ received messages:

   await()
       .atMost(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
       .untilAsserted(() -> {
           assertEquals(1, dlqMessageCollector.getReceivedMessages().size());
           assertEquals("test-dlq", dlqMessageCollector.getTopic());
       });

3. Verify DLQ Topic Matches Annotation
   Check that the DLQ topic used matches the annotation parameter

4. Verify Message Content
   Verify EventWrapper contains the original message and exception

CURRENT GAP

Right now, the tests only prove:
- The retry mechanism counts attempts correctly
- The aspect intercepts methods
- Exceptions are caught and retried

They DO NOT prove:
- Messages actually go to the DLQ topic
- The correct DLQ topic name is used
- DLQ messages contain the right data
- The KafkaDLQ.sendToDLQ() method works

This is a critical gap because if KafkaDLQ.sendToDLQ() has a bug or wrong topic name, 
the tests would still pass. The library could appear to work but fail to deliver to DLQ.
