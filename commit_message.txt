Fix retry logic bug and EventWrapper deserialization

Fixed critical bugs:
- Retry logic now properly retries instead of throwing immediately
- EventWrapper is now Jackson-serializable for DLQ consumption
- Moved test files from src/main to src/test for proper library structure
- Made Builder internal-only to keep API clean
- Updated README with clear documentation
- Added comprehensive tests (8 tests, all passing)

The library now correctly retries failed messages and users can deserialize DLQ messages.
