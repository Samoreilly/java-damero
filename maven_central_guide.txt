MAVEN CENTRAL UPLOAD GUIDE

CAN THIS LIBRARY BE INSTALLED AS A DEPENDENCY?
YES - once uploaded to Maven Central, users can install it just like any other dependency.

HOW TO UPLOAD TO MAVEN CENTRAL:

Prerequisites:
1. Create a Sonatype account at https://issues.sonatype.org
2. Create a JIRA ticket to get your groupId approved (java.damero)
3. Generate GPG keys for signing

Step 1: Update pom.xml with required information

You'll need to add these sections to your pom.xml:

- Project metadata (name, description, URL, licenses, developers, SCM)
- Distribution management (Maven Central URLs)
- Plugin configuration (maven-gpg-plugin for signing)
- Property for GPG key details

Step 2: Sign artifacts

Maven Central requires signed artifacts. You'll need:
- GPG installed on your system
- GPG keys created and published
- Configure signing in pom.xml

Step 3: Deploy to Staging Repository

- Use mvn deploy with staging profile
- Send artifacts to Sonatype Nexus repository
- Sonatype will review and promote to Central

Step 4: Testing with SNAPSHOT version first

- Upload as 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT to test
- Verify it downloads correctly
- Then publish full release (0.0.1) to Maven Central

HOW USERS WOULD INSTALL IT:

Once on Maven Central, users add to their pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>java.damero</groupId>
    <artifactId>demo</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

THINGS TO FIX BEFORE UPLOADING:

1. Change artifactId from "demo" to something descriptive like "kafka-damero"
2. Fix pom.xml metadata (proper name, URL, license, etc.)
3. Add javadoc generation
4. Add sources jar generation
5. Configure GPG signing
6. Configure distribution management

The library structure is ready, but you need to configure Maven Central deployment settings.

ALTERNATIVE: Publish to GitHub Packages First

Simpler approach:
1. Configure GitHub Packages in pom.xml
2. Use GitHub Actions to build and publish
3. Users install from GitHub Packages first
4. Later migrate to Maven Central

GITHUB PACKAGES IS EASIER THAN MAVEN CENTRAL

GitHub Packages workflow:
- No JIRA ticket needed
- No GPG signing required
- Automatic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Users can install with GitHub Packages repository URL
